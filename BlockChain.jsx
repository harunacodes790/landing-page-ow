        Leveraging Blockchain For Scalable Climate Impact
      </h1>
      <p className="text-white max-w-2xl mb-4">
        A new wave of innovation is reshaping how the voluntary carbon market operates.

        years if humanity is to meet its climate goals. Modernizing the entire carbon
        market infrastructure is key to making it both high-integrity and future-ready.
